# FizzBuzz_JSON
Unzip with 7zip
Coded on Visual Studio community 2015 on Windows 10.
When you want to put new set of values you need to stop and restart, going backward on the browser will not delete the previous values.
Also you may need Chrome viewer extension on your browser.
spent 30 minutes on the FizzBuz logic and 5 hours on the JSON, I had to learn it while coding. Thinking now I would make it different since the beginning, a form to take the inputs, a button to submit and then open the html.
I had started the tests but then  when I modified the API they became useless so i deleted them. If you give me 2 hours more I will correct and  add them.

Thinking now I would use the chain of responsability pattern and make different folders for the interface and functions.

Let me know if there are any issues.
